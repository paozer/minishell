The minishell project aims for students to recreate a simplified yet useable shell. Introduced/refined concepts include signals, processes, file descriptors, environment variables, Termcap library...

This project is subject to 42's norm which restricts naming conventions, function and line lenghts and more. Some weird sections may therefore be the result of said norm.

The final version of the project was rated 109/115 by three fellow students.
This minishell was a team effort from [pminne](https://github.com/M-Philippe) and myself.
